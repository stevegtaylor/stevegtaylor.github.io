Soil microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) function as bioelectrochemical energy harvesters that convert electrons stored
in soil organic matter into useful electrical energy. Broadly, an SMFC comprises three essential components: an
anode buried in the soil (the negative terminal), a colony of exoelectrogenic microorganisms residing on this
anode, and a cathode (the positive terminal). As the exoelectrogens respire, they release electrons to the anode,
which acts as an external receptor. These released electrons then flow through a load (e.g. a resistor), connecting
the anode and cathode. Though minuscule, the electrical power produced by SMFCs has a number of potential
applications such as sustaining low-power embedded electronics, pollutant remediation, or as a bio-sensing
proxy for soil qualities and microbial activity. This discussion aims to emphasize the potential of SMFCs in
addressing real-world environmental issues and to generate interest in the larger scientific community for broad
interdisciplinary research efforts, particularly in field deployments.
