Hi, I'm Steve Taylor. I'm a Computer Science & Engineering PhD student at UC San Diego with [Pat Pannuto](https://cse.ucsd.edu/people/faculty-profiles/pat-pannuto). I'm interested in developing new sensing and energy harvesting technologies in the name of sustainability. Some of my projects include being a lead developer on the open-source project The Open Sensing Platform, an end-to-end environmental sensing and visualization solution for researchers, and using microbes as non-traditional sensors and sources of electricity.

I did my undergraduate studies in the ECE department at UC Santa Cruz and worked as a staff researcher with [Colleen Josephson](https://people.ucsc.edu/~cojoseph/).

Personal stuff

In my free time I love to surf, hike, climb and just spend time outside. :) It's my love of the outdoors and the ocean that drives me to try and find enviromentally focused solutions.
